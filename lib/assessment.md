# Quiz: HTML

This file is a **markdown** file. Markdown is a special way of formatting text, and one that's used by GitHub in its README files.

In responding to some of these questions, you may be asked to write HTML or CSS code. Please do so using the following Markdown formatting.

**index.html**
```HTML
<html>
...
</html>
```

**style.css**
```CSS
ul {
  ...
}
```

Using this format will make it easier for us to grade you, so that we can get everyone their feedback faster. Thanks for your help!
